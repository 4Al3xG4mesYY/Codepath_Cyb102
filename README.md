# Codepath_Cyb102
### Summary
In this course by Codepath, I had the opportunity to use Splunk, Wireshark, NetworkMiner and other cybersecurity tools.
I analyze malicious file uploads and Phishing emails from .pcap files.
I also had a pleasure collaborating in a team doing a capstone project together.
